# Docker image for Homebridge with Home-Assistant plugin
 
This image uses https://github.com/marcoraddatz/homebridge-docker as base, much och the scripts and docker configuration has been taken from this repository, credit to the creators.
 
Instead of using the image straight off, it has been adapted for https://github.com/orbnedron/docker-home-assistant-getting-started
 
So documentation of configuration, environment variables etc can be foung in the getting started repository.
